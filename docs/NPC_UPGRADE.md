# Complete character population upgrade

This increment upgrades the actual Vaultline character population and its
presentation, not a separate character showroom. All models are original
code-authored assets under the repository's MIT license. No third-party character,
face photograph, texture download, external generator or runtime asset service is
required.

The result is a compact, articulated low-poly population. It is not photorealistic
AAA character art. The screenshots and videos in the validation report come from
the game renderer, at the characters' real world locations.

## Population coverage

| Production identity | Character / wardrobe |
| --- | --- |
| NpcCivA | Mira Vale, commuter |
| NpcCivB | Jon Keel, market worker |
| NpcCivC | Tessa Quill, commuter |
| NpcCivAsh | Nell Ash, market worker |
| NpcCivD | Pax Wren, dock/work vest |
| NpcCivE | Rina Holt, dock/work vest |
| NpcTeller | Lia Merrow, bank staff |
| NpcBankCust | Owen Pike, commuter |
| NpcGuard | Sgt. Hale, security |
| NpcDeskGuard | Ofc. Renn, security |
| NpcAlleyHmpd | Ofc. Vale, security |
| NpcFence | Cass Vesper, tailored broker |
| CrewRook | Rook, utility harness / technical equipment |
| CrewSparrow | Sparrow, scout backpack |
| NpcExtraGuard | Metro Watch, security reinforcement |
| NpcEnforcer | Syndicate Enforcer, heavy protective equipment |
| PlayerBody | Existing optional third-person player |
| GhostLoop | Existing network avatar, cyan identification vest |

There are **18 possible stable actor IDs**, **16 at normal startup**, and
**11 authored wardrobe roles**. Reinforcement/enforcer actors still spawn only
through their original complication triggers, except when explicitly selected by
the bounded inspection CLI. Replay trail markers are intentionally still markers;
they are not additional humanoid NPCs. All twelve original regular definitions
and both crew definitions now live in shared production factories, pinned by
independent baseline fingerprints.

## Visible changes and runtime behavior

- Shaped heads/jaws, eyes, ears, noses, brows, hair, layered clothing, hands,
  flat-soled boots, belts and role-specific accessories replace the box figures
- Independent skin/hair/clothing palettes and body proportions derive from stable
  IDs; role does not determine complexion, and near/far LODs retain identity
- Seventeen-joint deformation runs on the CPU for every backend. Normalized
  normals, geometry revisions, stable mesh ownership and original material colors
  reach software raster, CPU ray/path, OpenGL and the unchanged DX12 mesh interface
- Real traveled distance drives gait. Acceleration, braking, heading, arm swing,
  articulated crouching, idle breathing and restrained conversation gestures are
  blended rather than snapping or uniformly scaling the body
- Near/mid/far pose updates are limited to 30/15/about 8 Hz; gameplay continues at
  its own cadence. Models are constructed once, with no per-frame skinning
  allocation or topology rebuild. Dynamic respawns reuse cached meshes/entities
- Exact waypoint arrival avoids overshoot and early corner cutting. Existing
  authored routes, speeds, schedules, identities, dialogue, collisions, mission
  and payout rules remain under the original gameplay systems
- Crew follow offsets now match the camera's actual coordinate convention;
  player/network heading does too. Player crouch keeps the standing rig height
  and bends the skeleton instead of shrinking the body twice
- Q targeting now uses the camera's forward axes. A real Q bark also starts the
  corresponding actor's head/upper-body attention gesture; the original dialogue
  text and speaker roles remain unchanged

## Inspect the real game

```sh
# Normal game, all detailed characters enabled by default
./build/apps/vaultline/vaultline --soft

# Same game/controllers, previous geometry and animation presentation
FURY_NPC_DETAIL=0 ./build/apps/vaultline/vaultline --soft

# Frozen portrait at the original world position
./build/apps/vaultline/vaultline --cpu-ray --npc-view CrewRook \
  --width 640 --height 640 --frames 2 --spp 2 --bounces 2 \
  --no-hud --capture rook.ppm --npc-audit rook.json

# Real patrol simulation and camera following; 4 simulated seconds
./build/apps/vaultline/vaultline --soft --npc-motion NpcCivA \
  --width 480 --height 360 --frames 48 --capture-fps 12 \
  --no-hud --capture-sequence mira-frames --npc-audit mira.json
```

`--npc-distance 0.5..30` and `--npc-orbit -180..180` adjust inspection framing
without relocating the actor or changing collision. Small distances target the
face. Buildings, furniture, vehicles and other actors can genuinely occlude a
camera; adjust its orbit rather than hiding scene geometry. Static inspection
supports all 18 IDs; motion inspection supports NPCs/crew. Player/network motion
requires real player/network inputs, so those IDs explicitly reject the scripted
motion-camera option.

`--npc-talk` with `--npc-motion` invokes only the presentation gesture for
inspection; it does not manufacture a Q input or dialogue interaction. Crew motion
inspection in an idle mission demonstrates idle animation, not active-heist
following. The follow behavior is separately exercised by production-controller
tests.

`--npc-audit path.json` writes the character profile/work counters, a
`path.json.state.json` sidecar from the real NPC/crew/heist systems, and
`path.json.render.json` last-frame renderer metrics/source fingerprint. Parent
output directories must exist. Motion capture requires bounded `--frames` and
cannot combine photo or mission-smoke modes. [Frame capture](FRAME_CAPTURE.md)
documents sequence naming, output safety and FFmpeg encoding. Video cadence is
**simulated time**, not a claim that the game rendered at that live frame rate.

`FURY_NPC_DETAIL=0` is a presentation A/B switch, not a replay of old gameplay bugs:
corrected locomotion, targeting and mission behavior stay active on both sides.

## Remaining limits

- These are original low-poly authored profiles, not scanned humans, mocap,
  skin subsurface scattering, physically simulated hair/cloth, facial blendshapes,
  lip-sync, finger articulation or individualized voice acting
- Foot support assumes the existing flat ground. Exact straight steady travel is
  distance-matched; turning feet are not locked to arbitrary world terrain
- Navigation is still authored waypoint/chase movement without a navmesh or new
  dynamic crowd avoidance. This work does not invent interiors or repair every
  original route's relationship to decorative props
- Some mission world-state transitions intentionally relocate existing agents;
  animation does not turn those teleports into false walking distance
- Model skinning is shared CPU work, including on GPU renderers. A faster GPU does
  not remove it, and CPU ray tracing still rebuilds changed character BLAS data
- OpenGL is validated on Mesa llvmpipe here. Windows hardware DXR and actual
  discrete-GPU timings require those platforms; no hardware performance is inferred
