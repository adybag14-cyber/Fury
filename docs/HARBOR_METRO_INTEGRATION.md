# Harbor Metro → Vaultline integration

Content bridge for **Harbor Metro / HMPD / Meridian Mutual** authored meshes into the Vaultline heist vertical slice. No GTA / Rockstar IP.

## What landed (phases 0–5 + AAA polish)

| Phase | Piece | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 0 | Asset registry `name → glb/obj/lod` | `apps/vaultline/harbor_assets.hpp/.cpp` |
| 1 | Meridian Mutual modular heroes + KIT_* densifiers | `spawn_meridian_mutual()` via `build_meridian_mutual()` |
| 2 | Bank-block street dressing | `spawn_meridian_block()` |
| 3 | HMPD cruiser v12b pursuit visuals (material groups) | `apps/vaultline/main.cpp` + `PatrolCar` visual hooks |
| 4 | Rear-alley getaway (`hm_civ_van_v3`, material groups) | `spawn_meridian_getaway()` @ `(12, 0, -20)` |
| 5 | Traffic civ sedan/hatch/van v3 (authored colors baked into merged vertices) | traffic setup in `main.cpp` |
| polish | Heist route markers, mission lighting, NPC anchors | `harbor_assets.cpp`, `interior.hpp`, `main.cpp` |

## Interior source of truth (kit vs modular)

**Choice: modular heroes + KIT_* densifiers (not both stacked).**

The full `hm_bank_interior_kit_v2` embeds teller / security desk / vault door / deposit / chairs / cameras as `TC_` / `SD_` / `VD_` / `DB_` / … prefixes **and** environment densifiers as `KIT_*`. Spawning the whole kit on top of modular heroes double-drew the route.

- **Gameplay route owners:** modular hero GLBs (`bank_teller_counter`, `bank_security_desk`, `bank_vault_door`, queue, chairs, cameras, panels).
- **Atmosphere only:** kit prims whose names start with `KIT_` (floor/walls/lights/brochures/vents/scuffs/emergency/logo) plus `bank_trim_kit` and small procedural paper/monitor/cart stubs.
- Log line: `Interior source of truth: modular heroes + KIT_* densifiers (no stacked kit heroes)`

## Playable heist route

Floor pads + signage (tag `route`) mark:

```text
street → entrance → lobby → security → vault corridor → vault
→ escape side → escape alley → getaway → HMPD cue
```

Aligned with heist objectives: `vault_position ≈ (0,0,-15.2)`, `escape_position = (12,0,-20)` (Meridian rear alley). Restricted corridor stripe + entrance Meridian Mutual plaque for readability. No GTA IP.

## Mission lighting

- Interior catalog splits Meridian into **vault** (dramatic gold/cool), **security** (cooler cyan), **lobby** (warm brass) zones — most-specific-first for `zone_at`.
- Emissive ceiling lamps tagged `lamp` in lobby / security / vault / escape alley (picked up by night point-light path).
- Alarm: `alarm_lamp` strobe + red/blue emergency point light while looting/alarm active.

## Vehicle materials

| Role | Load path | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Getaway van / HMPD cruiser | `load_harbor_material_groups` | One entity per material — paint, glass, trim preserved |
| Traffic civs | `load_harbor_mesh` (vertex-color bake) | Authored colors preserved; one scalar PBR material |

## NPC anchors (#6 light)

Teller (`NpcTeller`), desk guard (`NpcDeskGuard`), lobby customer (`NpcBankCust`), alley HMPD (`NpcAlleyHmpd`) — existing humanoid NPC path.

## How to run

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build --target vaultline
# from a cwd that can resolve assets (binary stages meshes beside itself):
./build/apps/vaultline/vaultline
```

Assets are copied next to the binary under `assets/meshes/harbor_metro/` on build.

## Expected launch log lines (Test A + polish)

```text
Interior source of truth: modular heroes + KIT_* densifiers (no stacked kit heroes)
Meridian Mutual loaded
Vault door loaded
Meridian mission lighting loaded
Meridian heist route markers loaded
HMPD cruiser loaded
Getaway vehicles loaded
Street kit loaded
```

Supporting lines (GLB path):

```text
GLB prims loaded: harbor_metro/hm_bank_interior_kit_v2.glb (Meridian Mutual KIT densifiers, N parts)
GLB prims loaded: harbor_metro/hm_bank_vault_door_v2.glb (vault door, N parts)
GLB material groups: harbor_metro/hmpd_cruiser_v12b.glb (HMPD cruiser, N materials)
GLB material groups: harbor_metro/hm_civ_van_v3.glb (getaway van, N materials)
GLB loaded: harbor_metro/hm_street_props_kit_v2.glb (street kit)
```

## Fallback behaviour (Test D)

Never crash from missing art. Pattern:

```text
WARNING missing vault door …
Using fallback
```

(or `WARNING missing <label> glb … — trying OBJ / fallback`). Game continues with procedural boxes via the same philosophy as `mesh_obj_or()`.

## Acceptance notes

- **Test B — Bank walkthrough:** Enter south doorway → lobby (teller / queue / chairs) → security desk (west) → corridor → vault door hero → deposit boxes. Route pads readable; no double-stacked kit+hero teller/vault.
- **Test C — Screenshots:** exterior props + traffic/HMPD; lobby kit densifiers + modular heroes; vault door hero with dramatic lighting; escape with getaway + cruiser multi-material.
- **Test E — Perf:** Traffic retains authored colors in merged vertices but still has one scalar PBR material. Hero vehicles use material groups (tens of parts, not hundreds of prims). Bank modular + KIT densifiers. Simple **box colliders** for gameplay only.
- Pursuit / traffic / heist **logic unchanged**; visuals, lighting, route dressing, escape pad location only.

## Scale / material gaps to watch

- Civ v3 GLBs ship with large `ground_walk` / `ground_curb` helper meshes — **filtered on load**.
- Authored meshes are grounded at `y = 0` (pursuit/traffic `ground_y` updated from the old 0.85–0.9 box centers).
- ChatGPT Remaining Top 8 shipped on `harbor-metro-wishlist` — see `docs/CHATGPT_WISHLIST.md`.
- Soft-smoke profile: `docs/MERIDIAN_PROFILE.md`; cinematics: `artifacts/meridian_cinematics/`.

## Branding

Harbor Metro · HMPD · Meridian Mutual only.

## ChatGPT Remaining Top 8 (wishlist)

Implemented in `apps/vaultline/meridian_wishlist.*` and hooked from `main.cpp`:

1. **Mission state proof** — `Mission world state -> pre_heist|alarm|escape`
2. **Navigation readability** — frames / path lights / landmarks (no glowing arrows)
3. **Security depth** — MM cams in `SecurityNet`, badge gate, terminals
4. **Vault machine** — dial/bolts/LED/maint/emerg staged by `HeistPhase`
5. **Audio zones** — lobby / security / vault / alley beds via cue API
6. **Aftermath** — papers / chair / panel / glass on alarm
7. **Profiling** — `--profile` / F3 → `docs/MERIDIAN_PROFILE.md`
8. **Cinematics** — scripted beats → `artifacts/meridian_cinematics/*.png`

```bash
./build/apps/vaultline/vaultline --smoke --soft --profile
```

Expected extra smoke log lines:

```text
Wishlist: Meridian AAA props spawned (nav/security/vault/aftermath)
Wishlist: navigation readability (landmarks/door frames/light guidance)
Wishlist: security depth active (cams/badge/terminals/locked gate)
Mission world state -> pre_heist

Wishlist: alarm aftermath layered
Mission world state -> escape
Vault machine stage -> …
Audio zone bed -> …

Cinematic beat -> 01_exterior_establish
```

## CPU asset-pipeline audit and storefront integration

See [the complete shipped-asset audit](ASSET_AUDIT.md) and
[per-file inventory](validation/asset-audit.json). `Bldg3` now uses the authored
storefront facade through `replace_storefront_shell`; its original entity remains
collision-only, with unchanged transform/AABB and no new portal or interaction.
Off-footprint export helpers are excluded and missing assets retain the old box.
Per-material grouping, baked normal transforms, mirrored winding, import validation,
and cross-scene cache ownership have regression coverage in `asset_pipeline`.
